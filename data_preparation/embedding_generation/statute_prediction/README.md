Embedding generation model using statute prediction. Two variations of the 
encoder model are used:
 - BiLSTM
 - BiLSTM-based HAN

 The model is trained as a statute prediction model. Thereafter, the trained
 model is used to obtain the outputs from the encoder module which are used as
 embeddings of documents/sentences.
